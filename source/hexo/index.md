Hexo is a static blog and website generator created with nodejs (like Octopress without Ruby).

Using Hexo you can create your blog very quickly by writing your content in markdown, a simple text format with no-nonsense formatting.  I write my markdown in Emacs using Emacs Live as a base configuration, this gives a very simple and colourful way to write markdown.

All content is presented using the a theme (of which there are many available) giving a responsive website that looks great on the desktop, laptop and mobile devices.

Here is the approach I took to move my blog from blogger as well as adding other markdown tutorials I had created, all into one single Hexo website.
