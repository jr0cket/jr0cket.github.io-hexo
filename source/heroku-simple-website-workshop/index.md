This workshop will give you experience deploying and managing an application on Heroku, an elastic polyglot platform.

In the workshop you will cloning a simple website that uses the Express framework and runs on nodejs.  

No experience of Express or node is required for this workshop.  Changes to the website are made in structured text files, using a language called Jade.  

You will need an Heroku account and [Git](http://git-scm.com) installed on your computer.  You do not need node installed unless you want to run th project locally.  [Chapter 0](00-setting-up-your-environment.html) helps you set up your environment if you do not have these installed. 

For developers, the best way to understand the value of Heroku is to use it in a project.  If you want to know more about the platform, please see the quick [overview of Heroku](what-is-heroku.html) and visit the [heroku website](http://www.heroku.com) for further resources.
