# Heroku Workshop - Building lightweight JavaScript apps with Meteor

** Note: Due to issues like sticky sessions and other aspects of Meteor that make it unsuitable to efficient high scalability, this workshop will be replaced by one on AngularJS**

This workshop will give you experience deploying and managing an application on Heroku, an elastic polyglot platform.

In the workshop you will building a relatively simple JavaScript application using the [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com) framework.  As you develop your application you will try out the different features of Heroku and get experience using [Git](http://git-scm.com) to version and deploy your code.

For developers, the best way to understand the value of Heroku is to use it in a project.  If you want to know more about the platform, please see the quick [overview of Heroku](what-is-heroku.html) and visit the [heroku website](http://www.heroku.com).
