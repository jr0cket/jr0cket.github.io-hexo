# Trainng for the Ride 

You should do some!

Unless you regularly ride a similar distance to the ride you are undertaking, then get in some practice at least a month before.

Give yourself at least 3 days off from any cycling training before the ride.  Its better to do streatching and breathing exercises in the week running up to the ride.  Yoga is excelent for this.


# Preparing yourself for the day

** Know the basics of the route**
You dont have to learn the route by heart, but having a general understanding of where you are going and where all the places to stop are can save you time.  

**Things to take**
Taking a few tools and a couple of spare inner tubes can save you time should you get a puncture.
- tyre levers
- 2 inner tubes - Replacing tubes is quicker than reparing them.  Check your tire for any sharp objects before putting in the new tube.
- puncture repair kit - especially on really long rides, 200Km or more, in case you get very unlucky :( 
- a good pump - small but powerful pumps can be bought at cycle shops, even better if it has a tyre presssure guage on it.
- know your tyre pressures should you need to pump your tyres up after a puncture.  Most tyres state the pressure on the side of the tyre.
- a lock - if you think you will be away from your bike or it will be unsupervised at any point then you may want to take a lock

# On the day of the ride

Know how to get to the start point 

Check the weather forcast and make sure you dress appropriately or take clothing you may need during the ride.

If its an organised ride, get there early as there will probably be a crowd.
