# What is Clojure ?

Clojure is a modern dialet of the programming language LISP, running on the Java Virtual Machine and encouraging a functional approach to software development.

# What makes a programming language functional ?

A functional programming language has several properties

* Functions evaluate to values
As every function evaluates to a value, then you can use a function as a parameter to another function.  In clojure we refer to this as first class functions.

* Imutability

Imutability means that things do not change.  When thinking about state, this means that once a data structure or variable is defined, you cannot change its value.  For example in Java, it would be like declaring all your data structures as final.

* Funtions return a value (First order function)

When a function is evaluated it will alway return a value 


# Why Clojure

Beautiful language syntax
Highly productive language
Easy to write readable code (especially using doto / threading macros -> -->)
Writing scalable code easier
Immutability - keeping code more deterministic - no side effects
World of Java & other JVM libraries available
