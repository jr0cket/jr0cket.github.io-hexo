Emacs CIDER version 0.11 is just around the corner and has lots of updates and some really nice new features.  The new feature that grabbed my attention was the **enlighten-mode**.

The **enlighten-mode** shows the evaluations for all your code in-line, similar to the way LightTable does.  The enlighten-mode builds on the individual in-line evaluation that CIDER provides.

Another notible feature is that CIDER now works out the depenencies it needs and installes them for you
