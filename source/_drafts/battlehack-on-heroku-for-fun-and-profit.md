Battlehack is an amazing world wide hackathon competition and I was lucky enough to join in with the Berlin & Venice events this year (1st time in Venice)

Battlehack is one of the best run events I've experienced, thanks to the organising team behind it (Charlotte, Christiano, Joe Nash and several others).  The winners of each local event are flow to San Francisco for a best of the best smackdown.

Heroku are one of many great sponsors for the event, so I spend time helping developers at the events get their apps running in the cloud




## Battlehack Berlin 

Berlin is a great place for developers, it has an active startup scence and many tech communites

34 out of the 38 teams used Heroku for their hack, helping them do more.  As Heroku is easy to use, then I spent much of my time helping people design their app to run in the cloud.  Things work best when you have a package manager or another standard way to deploy your app.

### Notable mentions 

There were so many great ideas and teams using Heroku, that it was hard to choose a winner for the Heroku prize.  Here are some projects that really stood out for me:

### The Heroku winners

There idea was to help live longer by actively monitoring their health, especially heart rate and stress.  The team had seen a real need for this situation as many dont live a full life without cause.  They were very passionate about their ideas and I felt is was likely that they would continue to build out their app and service long after the hackathon.




## Battlehack Venice

Venice took my breath away, its such a beautiful place.  I got in early so I could export before Battlehack began.  Taking a water taxi from the airport into the city of islands gave me the sence of scale you dont get when flying in.  Walking throgh the narrow streets and wide open piazza, experiencing the amazing sights, sounds and smells, I couldnt wish to visit such an amazing place.  It even has pidgens, just like London!
