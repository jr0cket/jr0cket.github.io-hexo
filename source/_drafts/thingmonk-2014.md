# you like to modulate?

chirp.io 

just like the zx spectrum, you can send tiny data over the air 

pair devices
make payments
designed to look like a toy
an api for people to build other stuff on top of 
more stuff than there are people in the world

sonic languages - ways for people to interact with each other 

arduino + chirp = ??

extertential view of IoT
- what is the internet anyway, many computers, all friends 
- large amount of Interoperability over the local network 

iot is a bit like italy - lots of jossling for power and no one owning everything 

x as a service 
dir - yahoo
find - Google
rcp - dropbox
man - stackoverflow
w - Twitter
| - IFFT, Azpier
sudo - GHCQ

IoT does not exist - its a catatoery of categories - so we need to be more specific

negative externailities
- privacy - see Security
- secuirity - what Security
- longevity - landfil beckons 
- care & feeding - of needy puppies 

feel like a baby sitter, looking after needy and dumb devices, feeding them power & wifi 

Positive extrnalities
- no new business models - much new buisiness
- repurposed web _ web tech 
- Metalfe reconsidered - nodes are not people, so the model is much different 

### wearables 
do I actually need these in my life ?

### close to you
going from a WAN to a body area network 
pink glasses one of the first wearables, helping colour bind people see - also good for poker as you can see the blood rushing into peoples faces

watches are the charasmatic metaforna of the wearables - far too much attention given to these things 

a form of supersence 

[pictures on phone]

jet aircraft and automotive technologies are wearables - trains, airplanes, etc...

we wear each other - social networks reaching out further 

seven problems for wearables [picture]

more mobile phones than toothbrushes

smarter the apps get, the more power greedy they get -- far outstriping battery life evolution 

cisco says the wearables market is $30billion - although swiss watches market is $25billion 

examine active fantasies

# OpenSensors.io 
Yodit Stanton 
@yoditstanton

build open sensors to democratise the IoT.  Public acess to data was very important.  encourage the next generation of citys to give access to data

to monitorise, we connect all the things 
- you can subscribe to other peoples data 

ubiuitous computing is roughtly the opposit of virtual reality, where virtual reality pusts people inside a computer generate dworkd, ubiuitous computing forces the computer to live out here i the world with people Mark Weiser 

we are at the cusp of something quite great

I want to create programable cities, not just smart cities 

see polution data fed into city mapper, so if you have ashma you can avoid certain areas 

How are we going to do this 

how are we going to represent them ?  cant just give them the raw matrix feed 

Adrian Colyer's qcon talk - probabalistic data structures 

as a citizen - am ai going to get a parking space at 10am on X street 
- is oxford street busy at 5pm on 24th december 

maybe it should be my car that looks up parking spaces rather than the driver 

further resources - nedians and beyond: new aggregation techniques 

# IoT with impact - case studies for a smarter future 
tamara.tiltsoff@producthealth.com 
@tamaragiltsoff

environmental impact at product health 

principles in the circular economy 
- produt live extention
- long life of good
- ???
- waste prevention 

longer and healthier lives for powered products 
- just starting to monitor the sensors themselves as well as the produts 



Thank you.
