# My experiences

I began running events in the community back in 2008, with Ubuntu release install parties in a pub with a handfull of people.  I was amazed how many people turned up and how much more I learnt by having other people to collaborate with.

I like organising events and getting invovled in the community so much, I quit my job in the City of London and got involved full time.  I never worked so hard or had been so enthusiastic about what I was doing before.  I loved it.

After about 9 months a company called Atlassian got in touch and asked me if they could pay me to do what I was already doing.  It was a tough decision (no not really) and I official started my career as a developer advocate / ambassador / evangelist or what ever term you prefer.

Since that day I have organised well over 100 events, help start several communities, run corporate developer events for Salesforce and organised more than a dozen conferences.

# Where to get speakers

From Industry
From the community
By encouraging first time speakers (lightning talks are excellent for this)


# Are your speakers okay


# Code of Conduct

# Logistics

- make sure the schedule is clear, rooms are clearly marked, people know where to go
- get speakers to test the setup in advance

- ensure speakers know how to make their text bigger if they are showing code
- view presentations from the back of the room

# Dont do it alone

Organising a conference or even a meetup for the first time requires much learning and its much easier if you spread the work amongst a few of you.

With a small group of you its also easy to maintain a regular event

# Write down how you organise things

You can also use a planning tool like Trello to divide up the work and allow others to easily understand the status and if neccessary take over a task.
