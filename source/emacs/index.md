# Emacs

Emacs gives me a lightweight, distraction free environment that works off-line, supports a wide range of development lanaguages and has several decades of support and enhancements.  There is also a great community around Emacs and this has grown even bigger with the advent of Clojure (a lisp dialect on the Java Virtual Machine).

I typically use Emacs for Clojure development, markdown content, task management, HTML5 development and pretty much everything else that is text based.   

# Emacs Live

Emacs Live is a comprehensive configuration set for Emacs, designed to support Clojure development, live coding, highly colourised syntax highlighting and  many other common Emacs tools.  Emacs Live also provides a simple way to add your own customisations as well as override aspects of Emacs Live without loosing these customisations during an Emacs Live update.

## Installing Emacs Live

Ensure you have curl installed on your machine and run the following command in a terminal window

[TODO: copy install command here]


## Updating Emacs Live

The recommended way to update Emacs Live is to use Git.  So in the `~/.emacs.d` directory run the following command:

    git pull  

[TODO: check if there is a remote and branch to specify, or if this was set during the install script]
