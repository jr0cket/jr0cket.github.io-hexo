The [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/) is an online learning resource with 1600+ video library and is the most-used educational video resource as  measured by YouTube video views per day and unique users per month.

This ever growing library allows people to learn at their own pace.  As all the content is developed as an [open source project](http://code.google.com/p/khanacademy/), this could mean the Khan Academy becomes the free classroom for the World.

If you use [XMBC media centre](http://xbmc.org/) then there is a video add-on for the Khan Acadamy, so you can stream videos directly to your TV.

Thank you.
