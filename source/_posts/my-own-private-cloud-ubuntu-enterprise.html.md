I am in the process  of installing the Ubuntu Enterprise cloud using the Ubuntu server edition.  I intend to use the cloud for developer services to see how  feasible it is to make those services a real commodity. 

For example, continuous integration is a service that is growing in use  for software development and has on occasion peaks of very high load.  Some of the load could be distributed to the cloud as a service, reducing the need for extra capacity internally (which would not be  maximised) and turning that service into an operational cost rather than  a capital cost.

Some useful links for configuring and using Ubuntu Enterprise cloud:
