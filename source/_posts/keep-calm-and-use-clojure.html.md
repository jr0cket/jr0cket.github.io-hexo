A really nice [april fools from Cake Solutions](http://www.cakesolutions.net/teamblogs/2012/04/01/truth-about-scala-2/). I actually think this works quite nice as a sound-byte for the [Clojure functional programming language](http://clojure.org/) on the JVM. 

There are lots of [scarily possible april fools stories](http://slashdot.org/index2.pl?section=&amp;color=green&amp;index=1&amp;view=stories&amp;duration=-1&amp;startdate=201204m&amp;index=1) on Slashdot, although they are funny its disturbing how close some of them are to the truth.

My favourite [april fools video](https://bitbucket.org/spooning/) is from the [Bitbucket team](https://bitbucket.org/), making light of developers who are weary of pair programming... I definitely have to get myself one of these t-shirts.

Thank you.
