The promise of fast application development using the Salesforce platform is very appealing and the latest release has attracted over 800,000 developers.

[Heroku](http://heroku.com/) (part of the Salesforce family) is also attracting a lot of attention.  By allowing developers to deploy their applications with a simple `git push` command, it helps make continuous deployment becomes a reality.

These  are just two of the reasons I took the opportunity to join the  amazing team at salesforce.com.  So you can imagine I was overjoyed when I  started as Developer Advocate for EMEA.  Here is what that role is all  about.

# The Plan

{% img img-thumbnail http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/files/2012/11/the-master-plan.png %}

The plan is simple.  Help developers understand the value of developing applications with the force.com platform as well as the benefits of using Heroku to deploy their other application and services.

Starting with the UK, I am working hard to pull the current Salesforce developers together and build a strong community.  I'm also helping developers new to the platform to get a solid understanding of where they can use these platforms for their companies benefit and their own.

# Building the community

(% img img-thumbnail http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/files/2012/11/meetup-logo.jpg %}

One of our partners, [Tquila](http://www.tquila.com/), did a great job of starting a [Salesforce developer community in London](http://www.meetup.com/LondonSalesforceDevelopers/).   I have aims of making it this community more active.  In the last month we have seen a 300% rise in members and I hope we can keep growing with exciting [events](http://www.meetup.com/LondonSalesforceDevelopers/) in the coming months.

I am also looking for a few passionate geeks to start communities in  their own areas. Its pretty easy to get started and salesforce.com will create a meetup.com site for you so other developers can find your  events.  Those events dont have to be grand, it can all start with a meetup in a pub (like the developer meetups in [Bristol](http://www.meetup.com/Bristol-Salesforce-Platform-Developer-User-Group/events/88044102/) & [Leeds](http://www.meetup.com/North-UK-Salesforce-Developer-User-Group/)).  It just needs someone to kick-start it all and you will soon have a thriving community.

Check to see if there is a [Salesforce community in your area](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=210108725500451274783.0004cab36a064aa71872b&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=39.639538,0.527344&amp;spn=108.01067,270.527344 "Salesforce user groups world wide") and get involved to boost your career - and have some fun too!  If there is no group in your area, why not [contact us](mailto:info@developerforce.com "mailto:info@developerforce.com") and we'll help you start one?

# Bringing developers together

People can always do so much more with the help of others.  I see the community as an amazing place to learn, discover and share ideas and techniques with open minded developers.

Through the local Salesforce communities we are building across Europe, we will be running lots of different events.  Here are some we are lining up already.

## [Hack the Tower](http://hackthetower.co.uk) - getting practical

There is so much more you can discover by getting a group of developers  together and putting together an application in the space of a few hours.  I recently supported the [London Scala hackathon](http://blog.jr0cket.co.uk/2012/10/london-scala-hackathon-powered-by-heroku.html) where we used Heroku, Github, Play framework and MongoDB to build a community website in a morning.

Another variation is to bring developers together from the same industry.  Not  only will these developers face similar challenges when building  applications, they can work with each other to build services that  benefit the industry.  Our first mini-hack is with [developers in the media industry on 21st November](http://www.meetup.com/LondonSalesforceDevelopers/events/86354442/).

Using our space in [Tower42](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Level+27A%2C+25+Old+Broad+Street%2C+London.+EC2N+1HQ+%2C+London) not only gives amazing views of London but allows  us to running a series of hackathons for the many developer communities  around London.  Our first "[HackTheTower](http://www.meetup.com/LondonSalesforceDevelopers/events/91343352/)" on the 8th December in conjunction with the [London Scala user group](http://www.meetup.com/london-scala/events/91346712/).

## Developer Days
There are some amazing things you can do with the [Salesforce1 Platform](http://developer.salesforce.com/) and [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) platform.  To learn all these can take a bit of time and so to help  those new to the platforms we are planning "developer days" to  kick-start your journey.

The developer days will consist of a morning of discussion to help you understand the [Force.com](http://developer.force.com/) and [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) platforms.  Then you  spend the whole afternoon building applications, practising what you have learnt with guidance from our on-site experts.

The developer days will run across Europe in the coming months (_update: these are now called Elevate_).

# Who am I?

My background is mainly in Java development, although I have also done JavaScript, Python, Ruby and .Net apps too.  Recently I have been learning functional programming with Clojure (and Emacs) and [teaching what I have learnt](http://clojuremadesimple.co.uk/) to others.

I love learning [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) because its  an amazing new (and old) language and its great to deploy my Clojure web  apps on Heroku.  I also give talks and run practical sessions for Clojure, Java, Scala and other technical communities across the UK.

I have been lucky to work with some great companies in my time.  They  including Atlassian, several start-ups in London and several consultancy companies (mainly financial services) across the UK and Europe.

Talking tech is great fun and I love discussing all the possibilities out there.  Hope to meet you at a community event soon!

Thank you.
