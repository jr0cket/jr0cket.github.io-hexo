There are a great range of open source tools out there for creating 2D and 3D graphics, to help you create stunning visuals for your website development or livening up your presentations.  Here are some of the most widely used tools. 

<!-- more -->

[Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) is an open source 2D drawing tool that helps you create graphic designs, from simple buttons and logos to full blown posters and web page designs. Inkscape is similar to Adobe Illustrator or CorelDraw and gives you a vector based graphics tool that uses the W3C Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format.  See [my review of Inkscape Essential for web designers](http://jr0cket.blogspot.com/2011/02/book-review-inkscape-048-essentials-for.html) ([or the slashdot review](http://books.slashdot.org/story/11/02/28/1430231/Book-Review-Inkscape-048-Essentials-for-Web-Designers)) and [my Inkscape overview](http://ubuntu.jr0cket.co.uk/getting-software/graphic-design/brochures-and-posters).

[Blender](http://blender.org/) is an amazing 3D modelling and animation tool that has seen a huge increase in adoption over the last few years.  Blender has been used to create some stunning short movies such as [Sintel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&amp;v=eRsGyueVLvQ), [Elephants Dream](http://www.elephantsdream.org/) and the hilarious [Big Buck Bunny](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE7VzlLtp-4&amp;feature=channel).  Blender is also used to create many of the animations you see in advertising these days.  See my [quick overview of Blender](http://ubuntu.jr0cket.co.uk/getting-software/animation).

[The GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) is a very powerful image manipulation tool that allows you to tweak any image file format out there and has a wide range of filters you can use to create some amazing effects.  See [my Gimp overview](http://ubuntu.jr0cket.co.uk/getting-software/graphic-design/making-images). 

[Scribus](http://www.scribus.net/) is a desktop publishing tool that can be used to make multi-page magazines or company brochures or any other documents that need professional layout tools.  See [my Scribus overview](http://ubuntu.jr0cket.co.uk/getting-software/desktop-publishing).
