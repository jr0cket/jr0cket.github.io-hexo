Trying to see the heart of our galaxy even though its black... thats a major task for any visualisation project.  Not forgetting the huge amound of space and the sheer volume of data required if you were going to map the galaxy accurately.  This kind of scope is what I think about when people start talking about "big data" analysis as it helps me determine how relatively big their big data project actually is.

The [Event Horizon Telescope](http://eventhorizontelescope.org/index.html) (EHT) team is looking for the ring of matter which forms around the edge of a black hole.

As the main feature of space is its black and the main feature of a black hole is black... how are you going to see them :-)

If Einsteinâ€™s equations behind the General Theory of Relativity are correct, the matter around the edge of the event horizon will form a circle as it spins around the rim.  This will form an edge to an otherwise invisible shape and give some indication of scale of the center of our galaxy.  Exciting stuff.

Thank you.
