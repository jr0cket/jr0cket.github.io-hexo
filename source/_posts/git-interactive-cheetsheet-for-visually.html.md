Sometimes reading a big book or looking at a long list of commands is the last thing you want to do when discovering how to use a new tool.  So it was great to find a very visual way to show the git commands and how they work.

# Git Interactive Cheetsheet

The [Git Interactive Cheetsheet](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html) from [NDP Software](http://ndpsoftware.com/) does exactly that.  By clicking on different stages of your development workflow, you can see the related commands that you can use.  Hover over a specific command and you get a short description of what it will do.  The site also shows you the direction in which those commands work, supporting your understanding of those commands.

# In Summary 

It would be great if more tools have this kind of visualisation around them, especially involving the developer workflow that they support.

I have created some basic visualisation of developer workflows using Inkscape, an open source drawing tool.  The results can be seen at my developer guides on Github pages.

Thank you.
