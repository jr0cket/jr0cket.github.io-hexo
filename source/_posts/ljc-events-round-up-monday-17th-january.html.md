This Tuesday is a great chance to catch up with friends in the community and meet some new people at [our fun and friendly social event](http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/calendar/15926332/),  which also includes the Graduate Development community, London Scala  user group and anyone else who has a little Geek in them :-)  The [LJC social event](http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/calendar/15926332/)  has now moved to the very lovely Porterhouse in Covert Garden and if  you've never been to the social before we are arranging greeters to help  you meet people.

The [Scala coding dojo is back](http://www.meetup.com/london-scala/calendar/15631608/) after the holiday break, with new problems to solve and a fast  environment (new PC), so a good chance to start or catch up with your  Scala coding skills in a friendly environment.  This event is kindly sponsored by Thoughtworks and they provide pizza and drinks.

If you want some more practical stuff, the [Clojure coding dojo](https://ldncljdojo.eventwax.com/january-2011-london-clojure-dojo) is a great way to learn a functional concepts using [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).  You dont need to be a [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) expert, just interested in learning.  If you have never done any [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) before, we pair you with a more experience person (someone who has read at least 4 chapters of [the book](http://pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure)).  Its great fun and Thoughworks also kindly sponsor this event and provide pizza - [sign up](https://ldncljdojo.eventwax.com/january-2011-london-clojure-dojo).

# Summary of Last weeks events

The [London Scala user group event](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/how-we-mostly-moved-from-java-to-scala) was packed out with lots of enthusiastic people there to see "[How The Guardian OpenPlatform (mostly) moved from Java to Scala](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/how-we-mostly-moved-from-java-to-scala)".  Thanks go to Graham Tackley and the rest of the Guardian team for giving [a great presentation](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/how-we-mostly-moved-from-java-to-scala).

The LJC organisers had a brainstorming session last week and we have lots of ideas for 2011.  We still welcome you ideas and feedback on  events we are running.  Its your community, so get involved in helping us continually improve.

Thank you.
