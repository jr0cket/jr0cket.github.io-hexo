Talks  at technical conferences can give a very detailed insight into new  innovations, they be a great source of inspiration and motivation.  Sometimes they even make you giggle.

At QCon London I got large doses of all of the above, thanks to [Rich Hickey](http://twitter.com/richhickey), [Dan North](http://twitter.com/tastapod) (DWZ Trading), [Colin Humpreys](http://twitter.com/hatofmonkeys) (Carrenza), [Ade Oshineye](http://twitter.com/ade_oshineye) (Google) and [Patrick Debois](http://twitter.com/patrickdebois) (father of DevOps, working with Atlassian).As I didnt make the training  days this year, I was sad to miss out on the tutorials by [Simon Brown](http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/speaker/Simon+Brown), [Russ Miles](http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/speaker/Russell+Miles) and [Rachel Davies](http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/speaker/Rachel+Davies) which all looked great.

My favourite talk was definitely the "[Cloud... so much more than a tool](http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/presentation/Cloud...so%20much%20more%20than%20a%20tool%20fest)" by [Patrick Debois](http://jedi.be/blog).   Not only was it an interesting experience report on the realities of  using Cloudy technology to build a highly scalable video broadcasting  service, it was also the best use of LolCats I have ever seen... ever...

> [@jr0cket](https://twitter.com/jr0cket): @[patrickdebois](https://twitter.com/patrickdebois) has the best cat based slides ever - even better than [@swardley](http://twitter.com/swardley) which is saying something #qconlondon

[Dan North](http://dannorth.net/ "Dan North") was a cheeky a rascal as ever, actually making the audience think!  At a conference!  Oh, the humanity!   [Colin Humphrey](https://twitter.com/#%21/hatofmonkeys) from UK Atlassian partner Carrenza gave an overview of the fantastic  build pipeline they create for their customers, along with insight into  the business drivers of using such a build pipeline with respect to  IaaS, PaaS and SaaS solutions.

> [jr0cket](https://twitter.com/jr0cket) Adoption of continuous delivery is becoming ubiquitous, companies asking [@Carrenza](http://twitter.com/Carrenza) to deliver this via Platform as a Service [@hatofmonkeys](https://twitter.com/hatofmonkeys) [#qconlondon](https://twitter.com/search?q=qconlondon)

I had the pleasure of listening to Ade Oshineye sharing his experiences  when developing Google Buzz &amp; Google plus and how understanding how  someone is going to use your code is very important when developing a  public API, you cant just expect them to know everything you know.

Atlassian also realised the importance of the developer experience as it  helps engage with the wider community of developers as well as our own  teams, enabling them to start developing amazing plug-ins quickly.  The  last year has seen some real usability improvements to the Atlassian SDK  and our Atlassian Developers website and with JIRA 5.0 we have a stable  API that is guaranteed future proof for all future 5.x versions.

Everyone had great fun at the Atlassian party on the Wednesday night and very large Cenral Hall building was bursting at the seams.

Organising the Atlassian party was a nice little challenge as the hall was massive  and I had very welcome help from our UK partners: Gareth Wilson ([Adaptavist](http://www.adaptavist.com/ "Adaptavist")) and Matthew Buckland ([Clearvision](http://www.clearvision-cm.com/ "Clearvision CM")).

There was a great spread of food, although we did tease people a little by it coming out in stages!  There was also a great selection of beers, not  just bottled larger.  There was everything from Newcastle Brown, John Smiths, Spitfire, a nice range of largers and even some wine at the request of Trisha Gee.
