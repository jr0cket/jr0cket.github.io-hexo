Change driven through command and control or positional power has a tendency to fail rapidly.

People can only truly accept and embrace a change when they understand the value of that change.  Acceptance of change comes much more eaily if a person understands how that change will benefit them.

Change is hard for an individual, even harder for a team or organisation.

Change can happen when enough people realise others want change too.  If there is agreement on how that change happens then a positive outcome is more likely.  If there is tension and opposition to a change, conflicting views and value perceptions, then pain goes up and productivity goes down.

For management to introduce change successfully, they must persuade their employees that the change is valuable to the employees and not just the company (or manager).
