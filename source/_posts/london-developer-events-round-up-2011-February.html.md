# Events coming up

I'm looking forward to another [London Clojure coding dojo](https://ldncljdojo.eventwax.com/february-2011-london-clojure-dojo)  (now full), the last one was great fun and I will try and practice some  more TDD/BDD in clojure this week.  The format of the dojo has changed  and makes it easier to get more involved.  Rather than have two people  at a time with everyone watching, everyone is now split into groups of  four, having there own mini-dojo, with all groups working on the same  project.  There is a quick show-n-tell session at the end so the groups  can show each other what they have done.

# Whats happening in Java

It  would seem that Oracle lawyers are worried about shipping JUnit with  Netbeans and have advised the netbeans team to no longer ship JUnit with  netbeans 7.  If anyone knows what the problem is behind this then I am  sure we'd be interested to hear.  The netbeans team do have [a very simple way of allowing you to add JUnit when you first run netbeans](http://jr0cket.blogspot.com/2011/02/netbeans-and-junit-in-oracle-land.html), so its not a big issue in my book (yet).

# Interesting video of the week

There is an interesting  TED talk on how architects have learnt to build complex structures by  looking at nature.  I think is an interesting talk that helps you  understand the thought processes of architects and encourages you to  think outside of the box.  I hope you enjoy this talk at TEDSalon in  London by [Michael Pawlyn describes three  habits of nature that could transform architecture and society](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QZp6smeSQA): radical  resource efficiency, closed loops, and drawing energy from the sun.

# Summary of Last weeks events

Tuesday was another very successful [social night for the LJC](http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/calendar/15946232/) (and GDC,LSug,LCg,LtdWIPSoc).  In case you missed the event, I did a quick [write up of the night on the LJC blog](http://londonjavacommunity.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/february-social-night-summary/).

Great fun was had at the [London Scala coding dojo last week](http://www.meetup.com/london-scala/calendar/16048536/).   As with the Clojure and Python dojos, the scala dojo has also switched  to running the dojo as groups.  So once all the pizza was eaten we chose  a problem for the evening and split up into groups.  The problem chosen  was the Roman Numberals calculator and there were some interesting  approaches - as can be seen on the [LSug Assembla online git repository](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/lsug-dojo/Projects).

If you have write-ups of any events, please let the list know.

Thank you.
