There is a real challenge to improve the way you work whilst still retaining and increasing the amount of value you can deliver to your organisation.

The more people have the opportunity to step back and consider how they "get things done" the more opportunity there is for improvement.  It is tragic that most people are of the mindset that they are too busy to consider how they work as they have deadlines, this mindset is often driven by the system that is the organisation.

Until you can step back and really understand the work, you have little appreciation of the wasteful activities you do and therefore can really only "solutionise". &nbsp;Anything you that is not based on some "fact finding" seems little more than guess work or just following a trend and hoping for the best.

Thank you.
