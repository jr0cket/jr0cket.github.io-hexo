In the UK many enterprises involved in software development are realising  the competitive advantage of moving to a distributed version control system (DVCS).  [DVCS](http://www.atlassian.com/dvcs/overview "DVCS Overview - Gettting Started With DVCS") is now forming a vital role in their strategy towards continuous delivery.  This advantage is gained not just in switching tool sets but by adapting to a more collaborative approach to development and fully  understanding the opportunities this technology enables.

[![Enterprise Git repository management]({{BASE_PATH}}/images/ "atlassian-stash-dvcs-git-repository-management-enterprise")](http://www.atlassian.com/software/stash/overview)DVCS  enhances the way development teams interact, enabling greater  collaboration and communication across the enterprise.  This collaboration helps break down those islands of information which can  stifle innovation and productivity.  With guidance from [Atlassian Platinum Experts Clearvision](http://www.clearvision-cm.com/clearvision-atlassian-experts.html) and [developer tools](http://www.atlassian.com/software) from Atlassian, the path to DVCS adoption is made much smoother.

Those familiar with source control management tools like Subversion, Perforce, ClearCase  and Accurev, can learn to use DVCS tools fairly quickly.  Atlassian provide tools to get started both behind the firewall or in the cloud.  Atlassian's [Stash](http://www.atlassian.com/software/stash/overview/) helps with your Git repository management needs behind the firewall or Atlassian's [bitbucket](http://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/overview) helps you host your Git and Hg code in the cloud.

However using DVCS tools to their full  benefit has a considerable learning curve.  Whist you still add and  commit your files in the conventional way, DVCS has many other features  that need mastering before you get the full benefits.  For example,  learning how to use local and shared repositories for different stages  of the build pipeline as well as using pull requests across teams can  have a dramatic effect on the amount of software delivered.  I recommend  reading our [diffs and patches post](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/02/version-control-diffs-patches/), that explains the benefits of DVCS further.

Migrating legacy projects from SVN is yet another challenge, especially for the enterprise, but again leads to opportunities to enhance the development experience with your existing code base.  It presents an opportunity to refactor your repositories, understand your core domain and start to  isolate technical debt with greater effect.  When a large code base is  broken down into valuable components, the architecture tends to be more adaptable to change. Those interested can read more on switching from  SVN in our [centralised vs distributed](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/02/version-control-centralized-dvcs/) blog post.

[Clearvision](http://www.clearvision-cm.com/ "Clearvision Atlassian Premier partners in the UK") are a long standing [Atlassian Platinum Expert](http://www.atlassian.com/resources/experts) and have a great deal of experience moving enterprises away from large  and cumbersome source control management systems.  They believe that  source control tools should be easy enough to use and manage by  developers.  So if you have one or more dedicated resources managing  your source control tooling, then it becomes very expensive and a very  slow process to delivering software.  With the benefit of experience  from Clearvision and Atlassian products, developers can quickly  incorporate DVCS tooling into their software development life-cycle.

Clearvision recognised that we all have a large amount of legacy code running the  business, and have poured their collective experience into their [AgileSCM](http://www.clearvision-cm.com/agilescm/overview "AgileSCM migration to DVCS") offering, to ensure your chosen DVCS tooling is used efficiently  to develop and release products in a controlled, repeatable and secure  manner.

With guidance from our experts in the field, the path to  getting the most value from DVCS adoption is made much smoother. You can  discover just how Clearvision and Atlassian help enterprises move to  DVCS by attending the webcast [Migrating To Git: An Effective Approach](http://www.clearvision-cm.com/clearvision-news/migrating-to-git-webinar.html "Migrating to Git") on Thursday June 21st, 2012 (15.00 - 16.00 BST - [London time](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=136)).
