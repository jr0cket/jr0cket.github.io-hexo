This morning I watched [a really great key note from Uncle Bob](http://blip.tv/file/2089545) about how test driven development is very important to a language, not just in terms of writing clean code but as part of an professional approach to project delivery and relations with the wider industry.

In summary, Smalltalk was an amazing language but its community built walls to keep out the rest of the industry and did not accept that they needed tools to keep their work maintainable through testing (TDD).

I hope you enjoy this 1 hour keynote as much as I did: [RailsConf 09: Robert Martin, "What Killed Smalltalk Could Kill Ruby, Too"](http://blip.tv/file/2089545)

Thank you
