Thousands of developers flocked to [Devoxx](http://www.devoxx.com/) again this year and everyone I talked to really enjoyed the wide range of talk and the comfy chairs in the venue.  

Its hard to do justice to the experience in a blog post, so here are highlights of my favourite Devoxx speakers 

# Dick Wall and the Java Posse

Have these guys reached legendary status yet? For a number of reasons I think they should -  just for being out there and getting people motivated they deserve a medal (or just lots of free beer from [Atlassian](http://www.atlassian.com/)).

Dick Wall followed up with what seemed to be top attended session of the conference.  He talked about slaying legends (ironic considering my last statement) and encouraging people to think for themselves - I know, radical stuff!

In production the human system is not exactly foolproof a system, so perhaps we can do better with software?

Software development provides us with new challenges almost every day.  Whilst there are some great practices and tools out there you need to understand what you can get from them.

The most important thing you can do is learn.  The best way to learn is to try something and not be held back by fear of failure - learn to fail fast and adapt.

> Embrace change, learn, accept some failures, learn from mistakes, dont repeat yourself or others [@dickwall](http://twitter.com/dickwall) [@devoxx](http://twitter.com/devoxx)

Its natural for humans to find and identify with patterns, although when these are codified into "Best Practices" then it stops the learning process.  Best practices suggest there is nothing better, so people do not challenge their assumptions 

> Best practices ignore the paths not taken [@dickwall](https://twitter.com/dickwall) - missing opportunities to deliver effectively.

There are lots of beneficial practices within agile and software craftsmanship circles, however treading these as the only important aspect of software development can lead to very negative effects.

> Focusing on quality at all costs is a recipe for disaster.  Software should be for another reason [@dickwall](http://twitter.com/dickwall)

If you spend all your time crafting perfect code before releasing it, you would probably never release anything.  If you did, it would have a good chance of being the wrong thing.  Being brave and releasing code early and often is a difficult aspect for developers, but is a great way to learn what is important for the business you create code for.

# Diabolical developer aka Martijn Verberg [@DiabolicalDev](https://twitter.com/diabolicaldev)

There are many places in the world that are not safe from the [Diabolical developer](https://twitter.com/diabolicaldev), especially around London were he occasionally resides.

Hitting Devoxx with the most diabolical suggestions hopefully helped to shake developers out of any complacancy or overriding ego that stops the team delivering effectively.   Evil suggestions from Mortgage Driven Development to Compile == Ship It came pouring out

The diabolical developer also made an appearance with [Trisha Gee](https://twitter.com/#%21/trisha_gee) and the Java Duchess crew speaking on how not to treat women in IT.

# [Kevin Nilson](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/Kevin+Nilson) and [Stephen Chin](http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/Stephen+Chin) pair presenting on JavaFX and HTML5

Its always a great learning experience when developers pair, so pairing to give a session always gives you that extra dimention.  Watching these two present was fascinating and fun!

The guys gave honest and open comparison of JavaFX which most people thought was dead but seems alive and well and HTML - humour was about and no ego was on display.

# Alex Miller [@PureDanger](https://twitter.com/puredanger)

{% img img-topic http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Qu9j8SWzEEE/Ts-x7Oo_foI/AAAAAAAABJU/eNMLMbeKcXk/s1600/clojure-white-logo.png %}

Alex did a great job druming up even more interest in Clojure and gave some facinting insights into the language.  His first talk was aimed at getting people started with Clojure and I was great to see different ways of getting Clojure concepts across.  I am doing a quick refactor of my Clojure talk for the LJC conference this weekend.

Unfortunatley we didnt get chance to pair up and do some Clojure coding together, too many great conversations got in the way.

# Justin Septka - Atlassian

Justin gave a great talk on DVCS and understanding how to get the most out of Git in your own teams.  Git is relatively new to most teams and using services like Bitbucket and Github can give developers a lot of power to manage their code effectively.

Lots of advice was given out on how to manage your repos and how to use pull requests to manage feature branching and other aspects of continuous deliver &amp; deployment.  Its worth checking out the video on [Parleys](http://www.parleys.com/) if you want to know more.

Its great to see speakers getting feedback and there was a huge queue of people lined up to speak to Justin afterwards.

# Thank you

Adaptavist guys fired up some Microsoft Kinect love on all the big tv's outside the talk theatres. Dan Hardiker went above and beyond the call of duty and dressed up as a very large Java Duke for the afterparty.  He seems is a good dancer when dressed up!

Thanks to Stephan and everyone else (too numerous to mention) that help put Devoxx together.  I am really looking forward to the next one, whether that be in France or Brazil?
