It is not uncommon in IT projects that you are required to learn something on the fly or you see an opportunity to introduce a new technique or tool that would bring great benefits to a project.

How do you manage the learning curve required for something new without major impact to the project?

After reading comments from my [previous personal Kanban](http://jr0cket.co.uk/2010/01/personal-kanban-to-manage-personal.html) post by [Jim Benson](http://profile.typepad.com/6p00d8341cdbc253ef) and Bruce Durling, I thought I would expand on the Just-in-time aspect of Kanban.

I currently use my personal Kanban ([LeanKitKanban](http://leankitkanban.com/)) to drop small size cards into my backlog that are designed to tell me what I need to learn about a subject or tool quickly.  The cards have a set goal that should be manageable in a short time period.  Each card would have the relevant resources links to help me achieve that goal. 

When I get a spare hour I can select one of these and have a focused, time-boxed cards and get up to speed quickly.  If I have met the goal and feel confident that what I have learnt was beneficial (either personally or for current work) then I mark that card as a success.  If I don't meet the goal, then I will mark the card as incomplete and review it in a mini retrospective.  The goal of the retrospective is to help me write better cards quickly, as well as check that the topics I am learning are coheirent.

## An example would be good right now

I was at the Agile Testing user group in December and there was some discussion on continuous integration.  I realised that this area has really flourished since I last set up Cruise Control, so I created a group of cards on my Kanban to look at what's new in continuous integration and to reaffirm that I was up to date with the latest practices. 

In that same week as the meeting I had manage to review the theory (Google, Wikipedia) and learnt a new tool called [Hudson](http://hudson-ci.org/) (great tool, I recommend it, neatly integrated with Netbeans).  All this was pretty easy to fit into my busy schedule as I could easily visualise all my work on the Kanban and see what was important that week and what could wait. 

I still have several continuous integration related cards in the backlog, but for now I have refreshed enough theory to work with [Hudson](http://hudson-ci.org/) effectively in my project work.  If I need to learn Team City or some other CI tool, then I have a model to quickly tackle that learning.

This approach works for me at present as I break down the task on the card to something managable.  I am curious to find out how well I can break a large subject area down with this process, for example learning the whole of Spring 3.

For now I will be using this JIT Kanban learning to review and extend my Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) skills as I have a [BDD immersion workshop in February with Liz Keogh at SkillsMatter](http://skillsmatter.com/course/agile-testing/bdd-immersion-workshop-behaviour-driven-development-for-developers) and want to make sure I get the most of the workshop.  It should be a great day of learning as Liz has done a great deal of work defining BDD and [adding lean system thinking into the topics that will be covered](http://lunivore.com/?page_id=8).  There will be some homework to take away from the course, so I'll be using my personal Kanban to organise that work into my busy schedule.

Thank you.
