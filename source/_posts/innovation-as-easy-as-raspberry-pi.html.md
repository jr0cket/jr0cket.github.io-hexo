One use of the information radiator displays the Hindsight rapid board  view. This board has a column to show features branches (issues) that  need to be merged back to master and we conduct peer code reviews at  this stage (using pull requests) and the non-assignee will perform the  merge and close the issue. We use JIRA workflow rules to enforce this  with the help of the visual workflow designer.

[Hindsight](http://hindsighttesting.com/ "Hindsight testing software"),  a startup in the London Silicon Roundabout, are a great example of how  Atlassian software has helped companies get productive quickly.  Our [GreenHopper](http://www.atlassian.com/software/greenhopper/ "Greenhopper - Agile project management") and [JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/ "JIRA") software  help Hindsight manage their work and focus on the most  valuable activities to gauge how much return they are getting from the investment they put into their ideas.

To keep everyone up to date and heading in the same direction, especially  with all the change happening within a start-up, can be a challenge.   Even great tools like JIRA benefit from the wider visualisation of key  information, helping drive engagement with the work as a whole and  getting faster feedback so the team can stay on track.  Hindsight saw  real advantage in adopting GreenHopper, giving them an easily way to  visualise their workflows and keep things on track.

Using a [wallboard or information radiator](http://www.atlassian.com/wallboards/information-radiators) helps everyone on the team see, at a glance, the state of the project  and receive feedback from important systems.  They can visualise the  build pipeline, show the state of feature development for the team or  highlight real-time metrics for an online service.

These information radiators are often put together with what spare hardware,  then coupled to a large TV screen in a prominent work area.  Using the [JIRA Wallboard plugin](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/23983 "JIRA wallboard plugin") you can easily turn any JIRA dashboard, including your GreenHopper  boards into an information radiator giving you constant valuable real-time feedback.

Instead of wasting a lot of energy running  this information on older hardware however, Hindsighthad the idea to  create a low cost and highly energy efficient way of driving an  information radiator.  The recent release of the Raspberry PI gave them  the idea for their latest project.

# The Raspberry Pi

The [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/ "Raspberry Pi - computer on a chip") a low-powered credit card sized computer on a chip that is really  capturing the imagination of developers and start-ups - and even  enterprise scale companies such as IBM.

With PCs using between 60-300 watts of power they are not the most power efficient compared to  the Raspberry's 2 watts. The Raspberry Pi also has interface point that  can be used to drive [build bunnies](http://www.woodwardweb.com/gadgets/000434.html) and other physical objects that warn you about failing tests and code.

The physical size of the Raspberry Pi makes it easy to mount on the back of  the TV and a USB connection allows for a wireless mouse and keyboard to  be attached.  If you want to get really snazzy, you could even try wire  it up to a Microsoft Kinect and try the [hands free control of your GreeHopper board](https://labs.atlassian.com/wiki/display/KINECT/Interactive+Wallboards+-+Quickstart+Guide "Greenhopper hands free wallboard").

# The Wallboard

The Hindsight  wallboard has two dashboards configured in JIRA and they run as a continuous slide-show.  The dashboards contain the following really  great JIRA gadgets to give just the right amount of information for the  team.

# In Summary

Using  GreenHopper really helps get things done at Hindsight.  By visualising the  work it creates many opportunities for innovation and feedback on value delivered.

Discover how to [set up your own Raspberry Pi Information radiator](http://hindsighttesting.com/blog/2012/06/01/raspberry-pi-jira-information-raditor/ "Raspberry Pi JIRA information radiator").

Why not give [GreenHopper](http://www.atlassian.com/software/greenhopper/ "Greenhopper - Agile project management")** a try and visualise your key tasks, sharing them with the whole team or wider enterprise using the [JIRA Wallboards plugin](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/23983 "JIRA wallboard plugin").  It's amazing the kind of valuable feedback you can get.

Thank you.
