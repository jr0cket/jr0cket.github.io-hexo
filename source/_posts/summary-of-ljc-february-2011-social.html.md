I had a great time at the [social event for the London Java community](http://blog.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/2011/02/16/february-social-night-summary/), which also had people visiting from the Graduate Developer, London Python, London Clojure, London Scala, Limited WIP society and Ubuntu-UK communities.

A write up of some of my experiences that fateful evening are on the [London Java Community blog](http://blog.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/2011/02/16/february-social-night-summary/).

Thank you.
