A [Google Wave](http://bit.ly/7yiiQ2) has been set up for the [Lean and Kanban exchange being held at Skills Matter on Tuesday 1st December](http://skillsmatter.com/event/agile-scrum/lean-kanban-exchange). 

The wave will be updated during each talk with a summary, please add your contributions at the same time if you can - **wave is collaborative so join in**...  Dont worry if what you type it not perfect...   

[Direct link to wave](http://bit.ly/7yiiQ2): [http://bit.ly/7yiiQ2](http://bit.ly/7yiiQ2)

Or search for the wave in the Navigation panel or type in the search criteria in the Inbox panel search box. Either way you should use the following text:

    with:public tag:#leankanbanX 
    with:public tag:skillsmatter

> Until you follow a wave or are added by someone, you need to include the `with:public`, otherwise google wave will just look at your inbox.

 Once you are following the wave you can find it in your overcrowded inbox by using `tag:#leankanbanX` or `tag:skillsmatter` GoogleWave accounts are by invite only at present, if you need an invite please let me know.
 
 Thank you.
