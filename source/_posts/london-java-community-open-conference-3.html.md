On Saturday 27th November the London java Community ran their our third conference in two years.  The conference was a great success and was sold out, with lots of people on the wait list who didnâ€™t manage to sign up in time.

Everyone managed to weather through the winter morning and get there in plenty of time to mingle and warm up for the day ahead.&nbsp; It was good to have some time to chat about what we wanted to get from the day and there was a great buzz built up before the start of the talks.

The first talk by Martijn Verberg and Ben Evans on the future of Java was great, it is alway good to have pair presenting and these pair did a great job of entertaining and at the same time educating the crowd.&nbsp; A fluffy Duke mascot was used to good effect.

I enjoyed running a test driven development workshop aimed at those with no TDD experience or just getting started.  Using the [information I am building up about TDD on my "tooling up" website](http://toolingup.jr0cket.co.uk/test-driven-development), the attendees all said they were confident about starting TDD and so I was pleased I reached my goal.

I hope to run some Test Driven Development and Behavior Driven Development workshops sometime in 2011.

Whist I was running the TDD workshop, there were some very insightful discussions going on at the "Future of Java parkbench" session, with some really interesting information about the internal workings of the Java Virtual Machine.&nbsp; Maybe someone who was there will do a little write up??

Other highlights for me included:
* [John Smart's talk on Hudson CI and continuous deployment](http://conf.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/home/proposed-talks/hudson-ci)
* [Steve Elliot from Oracle covering the roadmap for Java 7 and 8](http://conf.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/home/proposed-talks/technical-roadmap-for-java-7-and-8)
* [Martijn Verberg's Diabolical Developer](http://conf.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/home/proposed-talks/the-diabolical-developer)
* [Markus Kobler on avoiding technical bankruptcy](http://conf.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/home/proposed-talks/avoiding-technical-bankruptcy---5-techniques-that-worked)
* [VisionOn.tv talking about their open source project to make open media work better](http://conf.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/home/proposed-talks/visionon-tv) - they showed a few short film clips too! 

Have a look at the [list of sessions](http://conf.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/home/proposed-talks/) to get a full view on what went on.

There were some great discussions going on after the conference in the pub down the road and it was great to reflect on the great things we learn and divising some plans for LJC events in the new year.

I hope to work more with the [VisionOn.tv](http://visionon.tv/) project in 2011 as it looks very interesting and is very community oriented. 

Thanks to all that came and made the day so special as well as a big thank you to all the other organisers.
