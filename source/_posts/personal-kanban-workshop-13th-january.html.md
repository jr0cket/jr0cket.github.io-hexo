To kick off 2011 and to help keep on track with our new years resolutions and goals for the year, the [Limited WIP Society](http://www.limitedwipsociety.org/) are running a [personal kanban workshop at SkillsMatter on the 13th January](http://skillsmatter.com/event/agile-scrum/personal-kanban-workshop/rl-311).

Personal kanban has been used to manage our busy lives very effectively by a growing number of people and I too have found it invaluable to get so much more out of 2010.

I would like to share the techniques I have been using with personal kanban, such as [just-in-time planning](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-scrum/john-stevenson-kanban-for-just-in-time-training), review techniques, managing events, keeping in line with personal goals, etc. The workshop is also an opportunity to show your techniques to manage your priorities.

The workshop will be a great opportunity to gather lots of ideas on how to make the most out of 2011.

I have written articles on personal kanban for [personal development](http://leanagilemachine.blogspot.com/2010/01/personal-kanban-to-manage-personal.html) and [just-in-time skills training](http://leanagilemachine.blogspot.com/2010/01/personal-kanban-for-just-in-time-skills.html).  You will also find the interesting material at the [personal kanban 101 website](http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/personal-kanban-101/).
