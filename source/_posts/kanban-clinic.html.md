<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[![]({{BASE_PATH}}/images/)](http://agileproductdesign.com/blog/2009/images/kanban_board.jpg)</div>At [February's Limited WIP Society meeting](http://skillsmatter.com/event/agile-testing/kanban-clinic) we are having a Kanban Clinic where you have your chance to build your own personal or team kanban board from scratch. You can also work with others to help them build a board if you want to see a kanban board evolve.

If you have an existing board (kanban, scrum, or otherwise), please feel free to bring it along (the design not necessarily the board) and get feedback and advice on any aspects you want to improve on the board.

There is no formal presentation although ideas and examples will be shown and questions arising from the practical work will be discussed.

The [slides and presentation video from the January Limited WIP socieity meeting are available](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-scrum/personal-kanban-workshop) on the SkillsMatter website.
