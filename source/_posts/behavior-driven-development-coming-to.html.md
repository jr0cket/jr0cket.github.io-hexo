[Hindsight](http://hindsighttesting.com/) is a start-up  company focused on building intelligent testing software that supports agile practices such as acceptance testing.&nbsp; Using the [Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/) to enable rapid development of their first tool, Behave for JIRA, they had a  platform to quickly deliverer a valuable product to a large number of  software teams around the world.

Atlassian competitions such as [Codegeist](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/codegeist) showed Hindsight how easy it was to get started with plug-in  development with JIRA and inspired the team to secure funding for their  own product development. 
 
Hindsight is passionate about software quality and is in the business  of providing tools to help everyone in the software development team  focus on quality of the delivered product.

Their first product, Behave for JIRA, brings acceptance testing to the  wealth of Atlassian customers around the world and at a lower cost of  entry into the market.&nbsp; If successful the company will look to extend  this service to the cloud.&nbsp; In the mean time the Atlassian market place  allows Hindsight to validate that their innovative solutions are  valuable to the market before they make a major infrastructure  investment

## Behave for JIRA – bringing Acceptance Testing to all your projects

Acceptance tests allow you to express specific needs for your  software product in a way that is testable and measurable.&nbsp; It is also  invaluable for breaking down the barriers in software development.

Behave for JIRA allows you to easily add acceptance tests to any issue in  your projects.&nbsp; Acceptance tests are written in a natural  language, eg. English, but in a structured way so that those needs can  be matched up to the software that is created to satisfy them.&nbsp; In [Behaviour Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development "Wikipedia - Behavior Driven Development") an example acceptance test would be:

    Given _a specific situation
    When _something occurs
    Then _you will get a specific outcome

The most commonly used acceptance testing framework is called [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/ "Cucumber - making BDD more fun") and supports many different software programming languages.&nbsp; Once you  have defined you acceptance criteria with JIRA Behave, you can then run  those tests with Cucumber to get instant feedback on you software  development progress.

As this is a plug-in for JIRA, you can easily make use of all the  data your projects and have a simple to use and powerful way to edit and  review your test specifications.&nbsp; This includes syntax highlighting  editor for quick authoring of requirements &amp; acceptance tests.

##   Developing products using Atlassian tools

As Hindsight have stakeholders with a vested interest in the success  of the company, they make use of the Atlassian tool-set to ensure  everyone is up to date with the progress of the software development.&nbsp;  Any non-technical people involved in the company can see the sprint  burn-down charts and understand the status.&nbsp; It is easy to see what is  planned and what the development team have committed to and hold the  team to account if they don’t meet the targets they set for themselves.

For the developers, using [GreenHopper](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/07/atlassian-inspires-uk-testing-startup/www.atlassian.com/software/greenhopper) it was easy to see if things were going to over-run and a decision  could be made quickly about re-prioritising the work.&nbsp; As this all fed  into a JIRA dashboard for the stakeholders, communication about progress  was updated in real time.&nbsp; When two new graduates were on-boarded, it  took just two sprints to adjust their capability using [GreenHopper](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/07/atlassian-inspires-uk-testing-startup/www.atlassian.com/software/greenhopper) to track and review progress.

The development team uses a Scrum-like approach, base on a two week iteration.&nbsp; Using [JIRA GreenHopper](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/07/atlassian-inspires-uk-testing-startup/www.atlassian.com/software/greenhopper) scrum template made set-up of the project as simple as defining a  project name and pressing a few buttons. The team have also used the  rapid board to manage their individual responsibilities so they can  quickly priorities the features inside the sprint.

[Hipchat](http://www.hipchat.com/) provides  an instant way for the team to to discuss challenges, especially when  they are apart.&nbsp; As Hipchat is also plugged into JIRA and their overall  build process, any significant changes in the project get broadcast on  the Hindsight Hipchat channel.&nbsp; This immediate feedback from build  servers, allows the team to quickly fix problems as they happen.

# 3 most valuable practices

1) Visibility to the business – stakeholders can see our commitments and easily hold us accountable

2) Distributed working is often a necessity and so having our up to  date progress accessible anywhere there is an Internet connection is  invaluable.&nbsp; Using Distributed Version control also means we can work  off line

3) In constant communication using [Hipchat](http://www.hipchat.com/) which also enables the team to see JIRA notifications on bug reports, issues re-opened tickets and other major events.
