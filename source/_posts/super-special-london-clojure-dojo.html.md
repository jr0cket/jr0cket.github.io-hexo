My brain was really challenged last night at the [London Clojurians](http://groups.google.com/group/london-clojurians) super special dojo event.  The challenge for the evening was the really hard [4Clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/) problems and they certainly were a challenge.

Our team picked some "medium" strength challenges and we managed to get one and a half problems solved in the hour and a half of the dojo.

The [4Clojure website](http://www.4clojure.com/) is a great way to learn clojure by practising, i.e. deliberate practice.  If you create a free account, you can also compete in the shortest solution competition, affectionately known as [code golf](http://lbrandy.com/blog/2008/09/what-code-golf-taught-me-about-python/) as the lower your score the better your rank.

Our coding efforts were pushed up onto [Phillip Potters Github account](https://github.com/ppotter/december-dojo) and I am looking forward to trying out some more 4Clojure problems over the holidays.

Hope to see you at the next [London Clojurians](http://groups.google.com/group/london-clojurians) event, usually every last Tuesday of the month (except December obviously).

Thank you.
