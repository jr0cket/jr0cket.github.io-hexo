Its not quite [Global Thermo Nuclear War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames), but battleships was a great choice for a coding dojo topic.  Its a simple enough game and therefore a challenge that you feel you can tackle within one evening.  Its also a game that most people know and have fond memories, so the discussions have lots of context.

If you are not familiar with the Battleships game, please see the [Wikipedia page on Battleships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleships_%28game%29). 

At the January 2012 dojo we used a [battleships server created by Neill Alexander](https://github.com/NeillAlexander/battleships) and Robert Rees kindly facilitated the night. The battleships server allows you to submit your "player" and proceeds to play battleship games against is own player - CPU1 (shame the player is not called Master Control Program so I could slip in a Tron reference).

To get started with the dojo I forked the project on Github to my own account and cloned the project repository to my local machine.  I still use the command line to clone remote repositories, its pretty straight forward:

    git clone url local-folder-name

For my fork of the battleships game the command becomes

    git clone https://github.com/jr0cket/battleships

> When I clone a github repository that I have forked from someone elses repository I prefix the local folder name with my username so I know its my fork and not the original - saves a lot of hassle wondering why I cant push changes back to github directly

The project is on my local computer I can fire up leiningen build tool and get the project running.  First thing to do is to make sure I have all the libraries the project depends upon.  Leiningen will download the Internet of jars for me (just like maven) with the following command:

    lein deps

The battleships project uses Clojail to create a sandbox, so its important to set the Java runtime environment security permissions.  There is a handy lein task for this courtesy of Robert Rees that creats a `.java-policy` document in the ... file:

    lein policy

Or you can just create the file with any handy text editor.

I then fire up Emacs from within the top level project directory (makes it quicker to find my project files) and opened emacs with the `project.clj` file to see how the project is set up. 

    emacs project.clj &

Clojure has a repl for working with the language dynamically, so I fire the REPL server up using emacs (of course).  Adding **clojure-mode** to emacs 24 gives you the swank REPL server - allowing you to call `clojure-jack-in` and fire up a swank REPl server using the lein project.clj project definition.  I defined a keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-c, Ctrl-j` for the `M-x clojure-jack-in` command in the `.emacs.d/config.el` emacs configuration file.

I then open the relevant clojure code using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-c Ctrl-f`.  For the dojo I just needed to work with the `demo.clj` file that defines a battleship player: `jr0cket-battleships/src/battleships/demo.clj`

Once the project is loaded into emacs and swank is running, load the battleships namespace into the swank server using the `(use ...)` function.

Note that `(use)` will load in all the required dependencies at once whereas `(requires)` will also require you add all the dependencies yourself.

    user+> (use :reload-all '[battleships.client :as client])
    nil

For the dojo we had a central server that we all submitted to.  I also spun up a local battleships server so I could do some testing.

    lein ring server

Now I am in the namespace I can submit the player I created - initially this was just the default demo.clj player as I was interested in a baseline player to work with.  By default the demo.clj player will shoot and place your ships at random, with no intelligence to these
actions

    user> (submit-player "src/battleships/demo.clj" "baseline" "http://localhost:3000")
    Submitting to http://localhost:3000/create
        {:status 200, :headers {"date" "Tue, 31 Jan 2012 21:24:18 GMT", "content-type" "text/html; charset=utf-8", "connection" "close", "server" "Jetty(6.1.25)"}, :body "player1912"}

When submitting your "enhanced" player you should give it a name you will remember, different from other players.  As the game does not replay any matches, its probably worth submitting a new player rather than updating an existing one (there would have to be a lot of players to overload the server!).

    user> **(submit-player "src/battleships/demo.clj" "Masher001" "http://localhost:3000")**
    Submitting to http://localhost:3000/create
    {:status 200, :headers {"date" "Tue, 31 Jan 2012 21:24:18 GMT",
    "content-type" "text/html; charset=utf-8", "connection" "close",
    "server" "Jetty(6.1.25)"}, :body "player1912"}

If you are playing against each other in teams, then the server address will be the  IP address of a shared server.

Now the clojure fun begins.  Using the demo.clj as a basis, modify your player so it wins all the games, or at least stop it from sucking more than everyone elseâ€™s player.

So if you want to have some Clojure fun with Battleships, go make your own fork of the [Battleships server](https://github.com/NeillAlexander/battleships) and get coding!

Thank you.
