[Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) is an Open Source vector graphics editor, with capabilities similar to Illustrator, CorelDraw, or Xara X, using the W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format.

I have been using [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) for a day and find it a really easy to use application and have create several posters for events I am running.&nbsp; Within about half an hour of starting with the tool I was pretty comfortable using Inkscape and being productive.

I do find it helpful to quickly sketch out what I want the poster to generally look like.&nbsp; I also found that using separate layers for background images, text boxes and text helped when building up more interesting designs. 

Once I've created my posters I can save them as a standard Adobe pdf file.&nbsp; You can of course save them as postscript as well as lots of other formats too.

As the default file format of Inkscape is SVG, you can also view your posters using the [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) Image Viewer or [The Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/).

According to the [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) site:

"_Inkscape supports many advanced SVG features (markers, clones, alpha blending, etc.) and great care is taken in designing a streamlined interface. It is very easy to edit nodes, perform complex path operations, trace bitmaps and much more.&nbsp; There is also a thriving user and developer community by using open, community-oriented development._" 

There is a great online guide to using Inkscape called [Inkscape: Guide to a Vector Drawing program](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/index.html) which is also available as a book.

There are more features I'd like to learn with [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/), to make even better posters, but it shows how good the tool is in that I can be productive so quickly.&nbsp; Have a look at the [Inkscape advanced tutorial](http://inkscape.org/doc/advanced/tutorial-advanced.html) for making your posters even more snazzy.

Thank you.
