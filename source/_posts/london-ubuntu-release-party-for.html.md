[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) 10.04 is released on Thursday 29th April 2010 and we are running a release party in Central London (for those that need something local and cant make [OggCamp](http://oggcamp.org/) in Liverpool.  The party aims to help people try-out and work with the Ubuntu Linux distribution and anything mildly related.

<!-- more -->

The party will be held on **1st May, 12 noon till around 6pm** and will involve helping or getting help with installing Ubuntu Linux, discussing what applications are people have useful and productive. I would also like to encourage show and tell for using Linux as a productive platform, especially in terms of JVM and FOSS development.

Turn up, bring your laptop or sit with someone else to learn or help out.  Bring a USB stick to get a copy of Ubuntu you can run at home without installing anything (you can install when you're ready). Have a read of the [new Ubuntu manual](http://ubuntu-manual.org/) and ask questions.

# What to bring

*   A laptop to run / install Ubuntu (or you can pair up with someone) 
*   A USB memory sticks 1GB or greater - bring additional if you want to try alternate versions of Ubuntu 
*   Lots of questions and enthusiasmThere will be electric sockets to plug your laptop into.  I will bring a few socket strips with me, but if you have a particulary bad battery I would appreciate it if you can bring a two or four socket extension.

# Capturing the event
I am setting up a [GoogleWave](https://wave.google.com/wave/?pli=1#restored:wave:googlewave.com%21w%252BagAKLQRmA)  to capture ideas and information from the event itself and will use  the twitter hash tag **#lurp**.

Please contribute to the wave so that we can share what we are learning with the others in the community.  If you would rather write articles in your blog, please add your blog post links to the wave or tweet them.

# What will happen
