The London Scala user group are running a [Scala install fest](http://skillsmatter.com/event/java-jee/scala-install-fest-mini-dojo) to get people going with the language and have a working environment to join in with the monthly coding dojo events. The wider goals of the install fest is to also decide how best to setup an environment for Scala. 

<!-- more -->

Some of the concerts we are going to address include:

1) Decide on an environment to write tests and code
2) Get the environment installed
3) Decide on a project idea to work on for the monthly dojo's
4) Practice with a quick dojo session (optional)
