Pattern recognition - [the iron chief paradox](http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/primers/the-iron-chef-paradox/)

As our experience grows with some activity, our ability to automatically recognise situations grow - we become what people generally term an expert.

Pattern recognition lets experienced people process information very quickly and so reduces time wasted thinking, reviewing or planning where its not needed.

If you can see you are on the right track, or just know you are almost subconsciously then you can get more done.

By visualising work on the kanban, you can also use pattern recognition to quickly plan your activities, recognise upcoming issues.

Thank you.
