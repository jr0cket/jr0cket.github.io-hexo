# So what am I talking about?

At [JAX London](http://jaxlondon.com/) I will be speaking about [continuous deployment](http://jaxlondon.com/2011/sessions/?tid=2213#session-19584) and how to make the best use of information radiators and dashboards to understand what is happening in your software development.

I will also be speaking about [just in time development](http://jaxlondon.com/2011/sessions/?tid=2213#session-19577), using the kanban technique to manage your work effectively and enable a 'yes we can' approach to changing requirements.

At [W-JAX in Germany](http://jax.de/wjax2011/) I get down to the code and show you how to get started with Clojure, a functional programming language on the Java platform.&nbsp; The Clojure language is a modern day (easier) lisp style and as it runs on the JVM you can easily call any object or class method written in Java.

[CitCon](http://citconf.com/) is a great opportunity to share our experiences Atlassian Bamboo, Jenkins / Hudson and other continuous integration tools.&nbsp; This will be the second year of this event and a chance to keep up with this rapidly evolving area.&nbsp; I will be suggesting some topics to talk about at the start of this open space style event. 

November 26th (its a Saturday) is the [London Java Community conference](http://conf.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/).&nbsp; As an organiser I'm biased when calling this my favourite, but it is amazing to see so much involvement from the London and UK community.&nbsp; We also get some great speakers along too.&nbsp; We are also planning workshops for those who prefer very practical activities and if there is interest I'd like to help people set up the whole Atlassian stack of product.

# Events I am attending

[Devoxx](http://devoxx.com/) draws in a massive crowd of 3,000 people and Atlassian will be running a session where you can meet us face to face and ask us lots of difficult questions :-)

If I have energy left I hope to attend the [Mozilla Festival](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Festival2011) at Ravensbourne University (next to the 02 dome).&nbsp; Its an amazing building, designed with lots of space to help people communicate effectively.&nbsp; I was there recently at their launch of Confluence for all their staff and students.

If you want to know what else I am up to, check out my [public calendar](http://john.jr0cket.co.uk/public-calendar) for other interesting events coming up.

Thank you.
