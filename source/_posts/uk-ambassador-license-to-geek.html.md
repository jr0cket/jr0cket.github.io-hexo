Atlassian, the people behind [JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/), [Confluence](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/) and other agile [development tools](http://www.atlassian.com/software/development-tools.jsp) have created an [Ambassador team](http://blogs.atlassian.com/news/2010/11/recruiting-europe-hiring-atlassian-ambassadors-evangelist.html) to  engage with local technical communities around the world. I am proud to  be Atlassian's first Ambassador, focused on the UK region and based out of London.

<!-- more -->

By providing valuable technical insight and thought leadership I will be supporting a fearless team doing anything  but the usual to support the technical community and get developers engaged with Atlassian. We want to show the world how successful software development can be how its the best job on the planet. We'll tell you  about stuff that is useful to you as a skilled developer, a nimble  project manager, an all seeing tester or a busy CxO. No fluff, just stuff - including some cool T-shirts!

## So who am I and why did I want to be an ambassador ?

I'm  a certified geek and I've been involved in development, testing and  consulting over the last two decades. Over the last few years I've  become addicted to community involvement: [running several technical communities](http://john.jr0cket.co.uk/community) (coding  dojos and code retreats), delivering dozens of community talks and  workshops on agile practices &amp; tooling, attending [events](http://john.jr0cket.co.uk/public-calendar) every week and [speaking at conferences](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/editor/archive/2011/04/13/clojure-repl-introduced-jax-london-try-clojureorg).

I  love getting people involved in creating amazing things so I am still  coming to terms with the fact that I can focus on community engagement full time, whilst getting paid to do it!

## So what's in the works...?

I  was serious when I talked about getting paid to do what I love to do.  So it may not come as a surprise that I'm planning on doing a lot more  of what I've already been doing! I'll continue to take an active role  within the developer communities: running events, speaking at  conferences &amp; user groups, sharing useful technical best practices  and showing off cool geeky stuff through our blogs.

Being focused  on the UK means uncovering compelling stories and lessons learned from  within the UK region. I'll be reaching out to thought leaders in the  community for stories, articles and tutorials based on their  experiences. I've already received requests from UK customers interested  in sharing their experiences as part of our [voice of the customer](http://blogs.atlassian.com/mt/mt-search.cgi?blog_id=7&amp;tag=plugin%20of%20the%20month&amp;limit=20) and [plugin of the month](http://blogs.atlassian.com/mt/mt-search.cgi?blog_id=7&amp;tag=plugin%20of%20the%20month&amp;limit=20) campaigns. If you are in the UK and are interested in sharing your technical experiences with the growing Atlassian community, [let me know](http://twitter.com/#%21/JR0cket).

I hope to meet you all at a [community event](http://john.jr0cket.co.uk/public-calendar) soon. To that end, the [**UK Atlassian User Group**](http://www.facebook.com/pages/UK-Atlassian-User-Group/105161882911735) will  change to a more community run affair (i.e. more beer). Our intent is  to ensure that Atlassian User Groups allow for more frequent, highly  informal, friendly meet-ups. In fact I am looking for a few customers to  step up and get involved in running the show, it's great fun and we [reward you](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AUG/Benefits%20&amp;%20Resources) for your efforts. If you are interested, [DM](http://twitter.com/#!/jr0cket) me or [apply here](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AUG/Start%20a%20New%20AUG).  The well organised events run by our local UK partners will continue to  grow and flourish, but just under a different and more accurate name  e.g. Atlassian Partner Events.

I'll also continue  my activities with other technical communities in the UK, helping to  generating lots of buzz around new features such as [team calendars](http://www.atlassian.com/en/software/confluence-team-calendars), [Bonfire for agile testing](http://www.atlassian.com/en/software/bonfire) and [(Darth vader) Kinect wallboard](http://summit.atlassian.com/archives/plugin-devs/kinecting-with-greenhopper) community projects. I'd like to organise events such as a plugin workshop to get people involved in our [codegeist competition](http://codegeist.atlassian.com/) with  a chance to win some serious cash. I will also be running events for  Atlassians to speak in the community and share the cool projects they  are working on.

Working with the [graduate developer community](http://www.grad-dc.co.uk/) and  several universities across London, I'll be delivering a series of  workshops on open source projects, development tools and agile  practices. The aim is to help students get the most out of University  and the [Atlassian Classroom License Program](http://www.atlassian.com/classroom/), so they can also run there own projects with the same tools used in industry.

But this is just a start. The real question is [what do you think](http://twitter.com/#%21/JR0cket) we should be doing in the UK community?

## I'm totally blown away...

This  is going to be a fantastic opportunity to help uncover the passion and  innovation within the local Atlassian community to help us all be  successful... and have some fun in the process. I'm totally blown away  by the opportunity!!!

Until the next community event, may the JIRA be with you...

Thank you.
