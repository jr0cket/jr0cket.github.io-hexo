I've added a new task to my [personal kanban](http://leankitkanban.com/) to look into how the [Drizzle](http://drizzle.org/wiki/Main_Page) project would provide a high performance database system for the cloud.

As the project is still in alpha phase it will be interesting to see what concepts and features are discussed through the projects growth.  I hope studying Drizzle will give me another perspective on the [transition of computing to the cloud](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/cloud-grid/situation-normal-everything-must-change). 

I'm also adding [Planet Drizzle](http://planetdrizzle.org/) to my [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) account to keep up with the Drizzle project news.

Thank you.
