My elevator pitch for kanban would be along the following lines..

_"Kanban is a way to incrementally and continually improve your approach to meeting your goals, by understanding the&nbsp;situation&nbsp;clearly, identifying the real challenges and testing out your chosen options for resolving those challenges."_

As with everything Lean and Agile, this elevator pitch will most likely evolve and can be made more specific depending on different audiences, but I am fairly happy with this general pitch.

Thank you.
