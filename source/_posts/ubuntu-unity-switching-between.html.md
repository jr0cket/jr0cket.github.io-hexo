I have really enjoyed trying out the new Ubuntu 11.04 beta release with the Unity gnome shell (desktop) and find it very fast and stable (after a quick upgrade).

As Unity is now using Compiz to drive lots of cool 3D effects, there are lots of new keyboard shortcuts to make use of.&nbsp; Here are a selection of useful keyboard shortcuts using the "Super" key - the one that has either a windows logo or an Ubuntu sticker on it. 

<!-- more -->

**Super + w**
Shows all the active windows across all your desktops

**Super + s**
Displays your virtual desktops, allows you to select a desktop or an application window on that desktop

**Super + [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]**
Pressing the super button plus a number will either launch an application or take you to the last active window of a currently running application.

**Super**
Pressing the super key shows the Unity launcher with the dash.&nbsp; When you select the icon for your application (you need to click once to hide the dash and a second to show you application window) it will take you to your application - or show you all the application windows if there are multiple windows open

Using the compiz configuration tool (ccsm) you can map these actions to other things if you so wish.&nbsp; I use ccsm to map Super + E to show me the windows just on the current desktop.

**Desktop toggle - Super + d**
To toggle between the desktop an your applications, use Super + d key, once to hide all your applications and again to show those applications that were hidden.

Hope this helps with your enjoyment of Ubuntu 11.04 and I am looking forward to the release just before the very long bank holiday here in the UK.

Thank you
