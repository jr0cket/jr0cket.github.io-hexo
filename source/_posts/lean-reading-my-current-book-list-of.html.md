My current reading list is loaded with some highly recommended books on Lean System thinking and the theory of constraints.  There are a lot of cross-concepts between these two areas and its been good to compare the ideas together.

# Theory of Constraint books

* [Theory of Constraints](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Theory-Constraints-Eliyahu-M-Goldratt/dp/0884271668/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264033291&amp;sr=1-1) - Eliyahu M. Goldratt
* [The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0566086654/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264033235&amp;sr=1-1) - Eliyahu M. Goldratt

# Lean system thinking books

* [Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth in Your Corporation](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Thinking-Banish-Create-Corporation/dp/0743231643/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264033098&amp;sr=1-1-spell) - James P. Womack 

> I started with the audio book for Lean Thinking, but have got the paper copy for reference as there was a lot of good stuff to process.

* [The Machine That Changed the World](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Machine-That-Changed-World/dp/1847370551/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264033038&amp;sr=1-1) - James P. Womack

After I have finished the above it will be on to the [poppendieck](http://www.poppendieck.com/) books by that time it will hopefully be time for the new book by David J. Anderson on lean and kanban that is rumoured to be in the works.

Thank you.
